v4.3
1.
sparse electron-phonon scattering matrix P? = sum_{+-,mode} G G nq.
this option can be turned on by setting "alg_sparseP = 1" in input "param.in"

this can speed up the calculation significantly but
note that scattering matrix P? may not be sparse at all (e.g., two conduction bands of GaAs)
in any case, you can search "ns_tot" in output to see
how many elements of P? matrices are larger than several thresholds (1e-10, 1e-20, 1e-30, 1e-40, default is 1e-40)
2.
reduce half memory by not storing P?_{jk,ik} with ik < jk, since P1(2)_{jk,ik} = conj(P2(1)_{jk,ik})
this will slow the computation a littile (~10%)
note that updated version of the initialization code must be used
3.
add an inpute parameter compute_only_dot
if 1, the code will report dot of observable, e.g, dSz/dt, at starting time but will not do any evolution
so that you can extract relaxation time at starting time without being worrying about time step magnitude

v4.2.3
use adaptive integraor (rkf45 method from GSL) for time evolution
now the following parameter are used to control evulution:
(i)
t0 - starting time. for a restart calculation, it will be read from file
tend - ending time
tstep - time step for reporting
tstep_pump - time step for reporting during pump (pump time center +- 6*pumpTau)
(ii)
ode_hmax - maybe understood as maximum time step for evolution
ode_hmax_pump - maybe understood as maximum time step for evolution during pump
                could be useful for coherent pump (e.g., 1 fs)
ode_epsabs - error threshold of time evolution, default 1e-8
Al above parameters except ode_epsabs are in unit fs

v4.2.2:
1.
units in input param.in are changed:
  energy - eV; temperature - K; time - fs, except tau_phenom in ps;
  magnetic field - T; length - bohr
2.
add probe:
  related parameters: probePoltype? (LC, RC, Ex, Ey),
  probeEmin, probeEmax, probeDE, probeTau.

  Now code has 3 band ranges: the largest one for probe;
  one where density matrix can be different from ground state;
  the smallest one for electron-phonon scattering
  Notice that in different subroutines, the default band range can be different,
  e.g., nb=8 in electron.h, =6 in DenMat.h and =2 in ElectronPhonon.h
3.
add phenomenon relaxation - \dot{rho} = - (rho - rho_eq) / tau_phenom:
  to turn on, set "alg_phenom_relax = 1",
  other related parameters: tau_phenom (in ps);
  bStart_tau and bEnd_tau - bands considering phenomenon relaxation, relative to starting band of density matrix
4.
add pumpMode "coherent" - real-time pump using coherent formula -i[P(t),rho]
5.
add oscillation factor exp[i(ei-ej-w)t] to probeP matrix
